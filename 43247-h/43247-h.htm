<p class="center spaced"><small>A SEQUEL TO "THE EPIC OF SAUL</small>"</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The action of <span class="smcap">The Epic of Paul</span> begins with that conspiracy
formed at Jerusalem against the life of the apostle,
which in the sequel led to a prolonged suspension of his free
missionary career. It embraces the incidents of his removal
from Jerusalem to Cæsarea, of his imprisonment at the latter
place, of his journey to Rome for trial before Cæsar, and of
his final martyrdom. The design of the poem as a whole is to
present through conduct on Paul's part and through speech
from him, a living portrait of the man that he was, together
with a reflex of his most central and most characteristic teaching.
Its descriptions are vivid, and it brings the reader's mind
into close touch with the great spirit of Paul. It is a poem in
which dignity, beauty, and power are commingled with a rare
charm.</p></blockquote>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Paul, the new man, retrieved from perished Saul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unequaled good and fair, from such unfair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such evil, orient miracle unguessed!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both what himself he was and what he taught&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This marvel in meet words to fashion forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And make it live an image to the mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forever, blooming in celestial youth."&mdash;<em>From the Proem.</em><br /></span>
</div></div>


<p class="center space-above"><em>AN APPRECIATIVE CRITICISM.</em></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Noble as was Dr. Wilkinson's 'Epic of Saul,' his 'Epic of Paul' is
even nobler. The kingliness of its range; the majesty of its principal
figure; the fascination of its subordinate figures; the subtlety of its
characterizations; the pathos of its interviews; the intricate consistency
of its plot; the conscientiousness of its exegesis and allusions; the
splendor of its imaginations; the nobility of its ethics; the stateliness of
its rhythm; the grandeur of its evolution&mdash;these are some of the characteristics
which make 'The Epic of Paul' another necessary volume in
the library of every clergyman, philosopher, and litterateur."</p>

<h2>THE EPIC OF SAUL.</h2>


<p>Saul of Tarsus, brought up at Jerusalem a pupil of
Gamaliel, the most celebrated Rabbi of his time, from setting
out as eager but pacific controversialist in public dispute
against the preachers of the Gospel, changes into a virulent,
bloody persecutor of Christians, and ends by abruptly becoming
himself a Christian and a teacher of Christianity. <span class="smcap">The
Epic of Saul</span> tells the story of this.</p>

<h2>BOOK I.</h2>

<h3>SAUL AND GAMALIEL.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">&nbsp;</a></span></p>


<p>Saul visits Gamaliel to submit a forming purpose conceived
by him of entering into public dispute with the Christian
preachers. Gamaliel disapproves; informing Saul that the
Jewish rulers are about to apply against those preachers the
penalties of the law. These men accordingly arrested and
arraigned, the Sanhedrim hold a council on their case, at
which Caiaphas advises accusing them to the Romans as seditious;
Mattathias urges stoning them out of hand; Shimei
recommends pursuing against them a policy of guile.</p>

<h4>THE EPIC OF SAUL.</h4>

<h4>SAUL AND GAMALIEL.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Gamaliel sat at evening on his roof<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And deeply mused the meaning of the law.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The holy city round about him lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Magnificent, encircled with her hills.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the torrent Kedron, sunken deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within his winding valley, Olivet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaned long his shaded ridge against the east,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Distinct in every olive to the sun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nearer, amid the city, chief to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glory of the temple of the Lord!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The seat was noble for a noble pile:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The summit of Moriah, levelled large,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spread larger yet, outbuilt on masonry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cyclopean, or more huge, pillar and arch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fast-founded like the basis of a world.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A world of architecture rested there&mdash;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Temple, and court, and long-drawn colonnade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On terrace above terrace ranged around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cloister, and porch, and pendent gallery,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Height, depth, length, space, and splendor, without end,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glittering its stones of lustre purest white,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stately portals rich with gems and gold:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The setting sun now smote it that it blazed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sight was torment to Gamaliel's pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Torment with pleasure mixed, but torment more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As there he sat upon his roof alone.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tall, and erect in port, unbent his form<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all that weight of venerable years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His head with almond-blossom glory-crowned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bosom overstreamed with silver beard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gamaliel stood before his countrymen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their stay, their solace, and their ornament,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One upright pillar in a fallen state.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fallen, for Rome had pushed her foaming wave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of conquest far into the East, and laid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Judæa under deluge, quiet now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But deep, of domination absolute&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A weight as of the sea upon her breast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jerusalem was glorious to behold,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Girdled with guardian mountains round about,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sunlit with her temple in the midst.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas, but more her glory, more her shame!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all her glory was the Roman's now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The queen a vassal at a tyrant's feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She Cæsar serving who should serve but God.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, worse disgrace than heathen servitude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There recreant Jews were found, and more and more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who their hearts sold to their captivity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And abjectly gave up the ancient hope<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And promise, dawning-star of prophecy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That yet to captive Israel should arise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Messiah, King of kings and Lord of lords,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To break the yoke from off His people's neck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gift them with the empire of the earth&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This crown of Israel's hope gave up, to choose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Instead, for captain and deliverer, one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Base-born, from Galilee, consorting friend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With publicans and sinners, hung at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Convicted malefactor on the cross!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Such thoughts and tortures exercised the mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of grave Gamaliel on his roof that eve.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Weigh heavy, his renown of sanctity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With wisdom, rife so wide, and holy zeal.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His head declined upon his bosom, there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the evening cool unheeded, he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gray reverend teacher of the law, sat mute,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rapt over the writ parchment on his knees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And read, or thought, or thought and read, and prayed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The veil was on the old man's heart; he saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unseeing, for the sense from him was sealed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In words like these his prayer and plaint he poured:<br /></span>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">&nbsp;</a></span></p>


<p>The Sanhedrim still in session on the apostles' case, Saul
speaks; first scornfully repudiating for himself Shimei's proposal
of guile, and then impressively announcing his own
purpose, now fully mature, to controvert the Christian
preachers in open argument before the people. After a
pause following Saul's speech, Gamaliel speaks in favor of
letting the prisoners go free. Other councillors express their
sentiments. A scourging of the utmost severity being proposed,
Nicodemus, with bated breath, deprecates first a cruel
infliction, and then any infliction at all. Release after
scourging is finally resolved upon.</p>

<span class="i0">Instinctively abhorrent from the part<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of that base councillor&mdash;at last there rose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A new assessor in the midst to speak.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Expressed of exquisite emotion, will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Elastic and resilient, tempered true<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bend, not break, and ultimately strong;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glances of lightning latent in the eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But lightning liable to be quenched in tears;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">My own reveréd guide, the guide of all,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Not what he inly braced himself to bear,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Allusion to the last advice, proceeds:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"But other speech my lips refuse, until<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I purge my conscience by protesting here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For me, I spurn, scorn, hate, loathe utterly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The devil and devilish lies. I have no qualms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At blood, but I love truth, and qualms I own<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Flushed from his heart his face to overspread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hide his thought, sat fostering the wound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Saul's disdainful noble words&mdash;a wound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rankle long in the obscene recess<br /></span>

<h2>BOOK III.</h2>

<h3>SAUL AGAINST STEPHEN.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">&nbsp;</a></span></p>


<p>Stephen, as a Christian preacher of brilliant genius and of
growing fame, is selected by Saul to be his antagonist in the
controversy resolved upon by him. To a vast concourse of
people assembled in expectation of hearing Stephen preach,
Saul takes the opportunity to address an impassioned and
elaborate appeal, with argument, against Stephen's doctrine.
His hearers are powerfully affected; among them, he not
knowing it, Saul's own beloved sister Rachel.</p>

<h3>STEPHEN AGAINST SAUL.</h3>

<p>Stephen, following Saul, turns the tide of feeling overwhelmingly
in the opposite direction. Saul, however, but he
almost alone&mdash;for even his sister Rachel has been converted&mdash;stands
out defiant against the manifest power of God.
Shimei appears as an auditor watching with sinister motive
the course of the controversy.</p>

</div><div class="stanza">

<h2>BOOK V.</h2>

<h3>SAUL AND SHIMEI.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">&nbsp;</a></span></p>


<p>Saul, sullen, gloomy, and chagrined, over his discomfiture
recently experienced, is visited, in his self-imposed seclusion
at home, by Shimei, who, always by nature antipathetic to
Saul, hates him virulently now for the affront from him
received publicly in the late council. Shimei exasperates
Saul with sneering, pretended sympathy for him over his
defeat at Stephen's hands; at the same time disclosing the
plot he has himself concocted, involving subornation of perjury,
with alleged connivance on the part of the Sanhedrim
in general, for the stoning of Stephen. Shimei gone, Saul, in
the open court of his dwelling, sits solitary, brooding in the
depths of dejection over the fallen state of his fortunes.</p>

<span class="i0">So, late, to Saul's superbly confident<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Saul wielded weapons of the present world,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Yet chiefly by repulsion lodged in Saul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spurning off Shimei, as the good the evil;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Saul instinctively was noble, frank,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And true, as Shimei instinctively<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was false, profound in guile, to base inclined.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But strangely, since that council wherein Saul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fulmined his shame on Shimei's proffer vile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shimei had felt the other's scorn of him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A force importunate to tempt him nigh&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perverse attraction in repulsion found!&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Not to be leavened with virtue issuing thence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But leaven instead to likeness with itself.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Shimei came to Saul, as knowing Saul<br /></span>

<span class="i0">This spirited attempt, I say, of yours<br /></span>

<span class="i0">This one alleviating circumstance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At least, that your defeat demonstrates past<br /></span>

<h2>BOOK VI.</h2>

<h3>SAUL AND RACHEL.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">&nbsp;</a></span></p>


<p>To Saul, wrapt in his gloomy contemplations, Rachel unobtrusively
presents herself. Conversation ensues between
them, and Saul confides to his sister his own most secret
purposes and hopes, dashed now so cruelly. The fact, however,
at length comes out that Rachel was herself converted
to Christianity as a result of Stephen's reply to Saul. Saul
instantly hereon experiences a violent revulsion of feeling.
He breaks away from Rachel, spurning her, and breathing
out threatening and slaughter against the Christian church.</p>

<span class="i0">With color&mdash;stuff of scarlet, linen fine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Embroidered, weft of purple tapestry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her handiwork&mdash;and sending after her<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To fend, if place perchance one then might wish<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In which free air to breathe safe from the heat&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There sat relapsed, deep brooding gloomy thoughts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When now his sister pausing stood by him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lovely vision! Moving, or at rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ever a rapture Rachel seemed of grace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which but that moment that felicity<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of posture or of gesture had attained,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By accident, yet kept it, through all change,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"Brother," she murmured softly, "thou art sad.<br /></span>

<span class="i34">"Nay, but thou,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My sister, thou thyself art to me rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And solace. Sit thee down, I pray, beside<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy brother. But to have thee nigh as now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Refreshes like the dew. I bathe my heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In thee as in a fountain. Ask me not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To ease its aching otherwise than so.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pillow me on thy love and let me rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In silence from the sound of my own voice.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Hate him well, Saul, and be at peace again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hate is safer, better, than to scorn.<br /></span>

<h2>BOOK VII.</h2>

<h3>STEPHEN AND RUTH.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">&nbsp;</a></span></p>


<p>Rachel in dismay soliloquizes. She at length resolves on
conveying to Stephen, through Ruth, his wife, a warning of
his danger. Ruth, not a Christian, expostulates with her
husband, attempting to dissuade him from his course&mdash;a
course certain, she says, to end fatally for him. After a
gentle, long, anguished effort on his part to bring Ruth to
sympathy with himself in his Christian faith, Stephen parts
from her with presentiment that it is never to return. Under
the power of the Holy Spirit, he takes his way from Bethany,
where his home is, to Jerusalem. His friends. Martha and
Mary, with their brother Lazarus, see him going, and follow.</p>

<span class="i0">When presently the storm a little calmed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within her, and she knew herself once more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She cleared her thought by settling it in words&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Words which through fluent mood and mood changed swift<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From passionate soliloquy to prayer,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I could have done it. Woman am I? Yea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Deborah was a woman, Miriam too.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The better spirit, for a moment lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So lately made her own, came back to her.<br /></span>

<span class="i12">"'Tempest'? Tempest sure just now<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Sit impotently brooding scorn for scorn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rival him? Surely I missed my way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Scorn,' 'hate,' one spirit both these speak, such scorn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such hate, in him, in me. One spirit both,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that the spirit of this world, not His,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Forgive, forgive me, from Thy cross of shame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And passion, O Thou suffering Son of God!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I crucified Thee afresh through shameful pride.<br /></span>

<h3>STEPHEN MARTYR.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">&nbsp;</a></span></p>


<p>As Stephen approaches the temple, he is suddenly arrested
and brought before the Sanhedrim. There making his defence,
he is interrupted with hostile demonstrations, instigated
by Shimei. On this, he bursts out with noble indignation,
which furnishes the desired occasion for a cry against him of
"Blasphemy!" from all, and for a violent hurrying forth of
the prisoner without the walls to be stoned. A file of Roman
soldiers confronts and stays the tumultuous crowd; but, after
parley conducted by Shimei with the centurion, their leader,
the rout is suffered to proceed. Meantime, however, a little
company of sympathizing Christians, including Rachel with
the three from Bethany, have gathered round Stephen and
listened to cheerful, tranquillizing words from him. After the
stoning, these friends carry the body of Stephen for laving to
the pool of Siloam, whence by moonlight up Olivet to
Bethany. Here they lay it in a room of Martha and Mary's
house until morning.</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">One churl among those councillors was found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Stephen gently bade his friends give way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even for his own sake, who could least endure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see them suffer roughness, most unmeet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For such as they&mdash;one graceless churl was found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To raise his hand at Stephen speaking so<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smite him on the mouth. A wail at this<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Broke from those women, and their hair they tore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In passion of compassion and of wrath<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Holy as love. But Stephen was most meek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And only in a shadowed look expressed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pain at such painful sympathy with pain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This seen by those, they soon responsively<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resumed composure like his own, and walked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Following, molested not, at small remove<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So, on, with going less precipitate,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And maddened, both at once, to feel themselves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only by sufferance masters of the fate<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As Stephen fell asleep, the sun went down;<br /></span>

<h2>BOOK IX.</h2>

<h3>RUTH AND RACHEL.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">&nbsp;</a></span></p>


<p>Very early in the morning, Rachel, charged with this office
by Stephen, breaks to Ruth the news of her husband's death.
The two then go together to the place where the body of
Stephen is laid. There, Ruth, kneeling in prayer beside her
martyred husband, repentantly accepts his Lord for hers, becoming
a Christian. Rachel, having hastily visited her home,
to find Saul gone thence with purpose not to return, leaves
the house in her maid's care and goes back to Ruth, to whom,
being requested to do so, she tells the story of Stephen's
stoning. Then the funeral of Stephen takes place, with a
memorial discourse pronounced, and an elegy recited, at the
tomb.</p>

<h4>RUTH AND RACHEL.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The morrow morn broke fair in Bethany,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Ruth rose early from unquiet sleep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rachel likewise, who slept in Mary's house.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun had not yet risen, but in the west<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moon hung whitening opposite the dawn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Ruth, her children left asleep, went forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To feel the freshness of the morning air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without, and water from the village well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To draw, both for the slaking of her thirst<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for the cooling of her brow that burned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of her throbbing temples. At the well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rachel she met who earlier still was forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the like errand. The two women hailed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kissed each other. Ruth to Rachel then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said: "Thou art not, I trow, this morning come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hither the long way from Jerusalem?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Nay, Ruth," said Rachel, "here the yesternight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Mary and Martha I abode a guest."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>"How fresh the wind is," Ruth said, "hither blown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From off the western sea! Us, underneath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crest of Olivet, it lights upon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Descending, broken, like a breath from heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What a delicious balm!"<br /></span>

<span class="i28">"About my brow,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said Rachel, "gratefully I feel the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Attempered so, soft flowing, as if one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That loved me like a mother gently stroked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My temples to undo a band of pain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bound round them."<br /></span>

<span class="i20">"And, in sooth," the other said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now looking narrowly at Rachel's face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Thou seemest sad of favor, Rachel. Thou,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou too, so young, hast then thy cause to grieve!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is a sad world and a weary. But&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forgive me if such quick instinctive fears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be selfish, I am wife and mother&mdash;aught<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of evil tidings bringest thou me? Spare not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To speak. Thou wilt but answer to the dreams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I had this night, portending nameless ill.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stephen&mdash;I fear for him. He yesterday<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Left me beyond his wont oppressed in spirit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And has not since returned. Strange&mdash;yet not strange;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes the livelong night he spends in prayer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone upon the top of Olivet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or in the shadows of Gethsemane."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ruth," Rachel said, "the Angel of the Lord<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round His belovéd, like the mountains round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jerusalem, encampeth ever; he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of God's belovéd is, and guarded well!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But Ruth scarce listened; she insisting said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Perhaps of Stephen some report thou bringest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hint doubtless of new danger threatening him!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Nay, Ruth, no longer danger threatens now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy husband; that is past, and he is safe."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thank God," said Ruth; "but stay, I dare not yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thank God. Tell me, have then our rulers ceased<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To frown on Stephen preaching Jesus Christ?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or Stephen, will he cease and preach no more?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This cannot be, for Stephen is such stuff<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As never yet did bend to mortal beck;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that&mdash;our rulers surely have not changed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus suddenly their mind. Thou art deceived,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They have deceived thee&mdash;Stephen is not safe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is their guile to make us think him safe,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He off his guard will fall an easier prey<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into their hands. Rachel, it was not kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not faithful in thee so to be deceived.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More love had made thee more suspicious. I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suspect forever everybody; thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now I suspect. Thou keepest something back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or haply palterest with a double sense.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rachel, I charge thee, I adjure thee, speak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tell me all. Stephen is dead! Say that&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is dead! Thou meantest that by, 'He is safe.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They have stoned him, stoned my husband, stoned the man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That was the truest Hebrew of them all!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Though by her words Ruth challenged frank reply,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet by her tones and by her eager looks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She deprecated more what she invoked.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This Rachel saw, and answered not a word.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Ruth gainsaid what Rachel would not say:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"They have not done it, could not do it, he&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rachel, it is not true, unsay it, quick,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was a cruel jest to tease me so,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art not a wife, thou art not a mother, else<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou never hadst conceived so ill a jest!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>Rachel was tortured, but she could not speak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Ruth, secure in sense of respite yet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went on invoking what she would not hear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Why art thou silent? Speak, and keep not back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The truth, whatever it may be; there's naught<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So soothing and so healing as the truth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I will not believe that he is dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou didst not know my husband. Dead! dead! dead!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I tell thee, Rachel, <em>that</em> is something past<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Imagining dreadful, hopeless. To be dead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is&mdash;not to love, and not to speak to those<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who loved and love thee, not to hear them speak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saying they loved and love thee and lament<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They ever gave thee cause of grief and now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are different and would die a thousand deaths<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To have been different then when thou couldst know&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Death, Rachel,&mdash;but of death what canst thou learn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For thou art but a child and never wast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never, to such a husband such a wife&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To vex the noblest heart that ever broke!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Rachel at first had listened with dismay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nothing found to answer to Ruth's words,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Whose words indeed flowed on and made no pause<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For answer, as if she in truest truth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sought not the answer that she seemed to seek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would fain postpone it rather, or avert.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when at length the utterance of Ruth's thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From converse passed into soliloquy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the deep secret of her soul revealed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Rachel caught a welcome gleam of hope.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sign of grace she saw or seemed to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At work for Ruth within her heart of grief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Transmuting human sorrow to divine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Repentance, and for pain preparing peace.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Let us go in together," Rachel said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For they by this were nigh to Ruth's abode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Let us go in where we may be withdrawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From note of such as here might mark our speech<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or action; I have word from him to thee."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then they went in, and Ruth bestirred herself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make a cheer of welcome for her guest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That momentary truce to troubled thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Ruth, and interspace of quietness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From her own words which could not choose but flow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With helpless importunity till then,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Gave Rachel needed chance to speak. She said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O Ruth, thy husband fell asleep last night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And slept a sweeter sleep than thine or mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A deep sweet sleep, a happy sleep, a blest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou wouldst not wake him thence for worlds on worlds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He felt before he slept that he should sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And me, whom God our Father let be nigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stephen bade bear a last good-night to thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He did not think the night was very long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before him for his sleeping, and his wish<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was thou shouldst meet him presently to say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good-morning. This was his true message, Ruth."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The ineffably serene steadfast regard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Rachel's eyes, that, out of liquid depths<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unsounded, looked angelic love and truth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With pity mingled, equal measure&mdash;tears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Orbing them large, shot through and through with light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of heavenly hope for Ruth&mdash;but, more than all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A subtly sweet insinuating tone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most musical, of softness in the voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That gently wound into the listener's heart&mdash;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
<span class="i0">These, with what else, who knows? of help from Heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wrought a bright miracle of change in Ruth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She had been hard and dry, a desert rock;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rock was smitten now with Moses' rod.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ruth gushed in gracious tears, she veiled herself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With weeping, as sometimes a precipice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Veils itself dim with mist of cataract.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Rachel wept with Ruth, until Ruth said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"But where is Stephen, Rachel? It might be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They, meaning death, yet did not compass death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such things have been; haste, let us go and see.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Monstrous it were, if he should need me&mdash;I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The while here sitting weeping idle tears!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Come," Rachel said, and took her by the hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So hand in hand they went to Mary's house,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The elder guided as the younger led,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And neither speaking, stilled with solemn thought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mary and Martha met the twain, with mute,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Subdued, affectionate greeting, at the door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, understanding without word their wish,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Straight led them inward, with a quietude<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of gesture that spoke peace and peace infused,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
<span class="i0">To the place where in quietude reposed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That slumberer late so violently lulled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To this so placid sleep. The room was flushed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With hue of gold in hangings round the walls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rugs of russet muffling deep the floor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That made a kind of inner light diffused,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like sunshine without sun and shadowless.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A golden-curtained window opened east,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And east the upturned face of Stephen looked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lying there motionless in that fast sleep&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So lying that, had he his eyelids raised,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He without moving might have seen the morn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rest, with one accord not entering, stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About the door without, silent, and saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the wife sole went to the husband's side.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That instant, lo, from out the breaking dawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A level sunbeam through the curtain slipped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And touched the fair translucent face with light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ruth marked it and she testified and said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Falling upon her knees beside the couch:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I take it as a token, Lord, from Thee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even so send Thou Thy light into my heart!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, by the side of him made beautiful<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In death, of whom I was unworthy, here<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
<span class="i0">I give myself&mdash;alas, that it should be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too late for him to have known it!&mdash;to his Lord.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I trust to be forgiven for my sin!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I thank Thee that I was not weight enough<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon him to prevail against Thy might<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within him and prevent this sacrifice&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Accomplished all without my help, nay, all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In spite of my resistance! O my God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How hast Thou humbled me! To have had no part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wife with her husband to have borne no part&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save hindering what she could!&mdash;when such a deed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of martyrdom for Christ was possible!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold, O Lord, thus late I take my part!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This now is also mine, as well as his,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This sacrifice. I have offered him to Thee!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if my share be heavier even than his&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To live bereaved more grievous martyrdom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than to have died&mdash;this too is my desert,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Accept the witness of my widowhood!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ruth ceased, but rose not from her knees, still fixed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In posture as if grown a pillar of prayer.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then those three women came and knelt with her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside her dead, a silent fellowship<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Of sympathy in sacrifice; but soon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rachel and Mary, one on either side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Ruth, borne by the self-same impulse each,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each at the self-same instant borne, unto<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The self-same beautiful appeal, pure love's<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pure touch, stole softly each a hand in hers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each plighting hand so proffered Ruth upraised<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slowly and solemnly as with a kind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of consecrating gesture to her lips,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kissing seemed to seal a sacrament.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then she arose, and all arose with her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Martha, not forgotten, likewise shared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She too, with Ruth the kiss of sisterhood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, never a word between them spoken, all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went backward and withdrew, Ruth last, who saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sunshine glorifying Stephen's brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bore it thence, Shekinah in her heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her countenance thus illumined from within,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mother to her orphan children went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And moved, a light, about her household ways.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She knew that others would with holy heed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prepare that holy dust for burial.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But Rachel was more comfortless than Ruth.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Rest in her spirit found she none&mdash;until,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First having broken fast, but sparingly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She hastened with winged footsteps to her home.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There her maid told her Saul went early forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaving this message for his sister: "Here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bide, if thou wilt; this house be still thy home.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I go hence, whither I cannot tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor yet for how long absence; to what end&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou knowest. Cheer thee well!" The little maid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looked rueful and perplexed, but nothing asked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As nothing Rachel told her, save to say:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Quick, bring thine elder sister, thou and she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall keep the house together for a time.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I also go, my little maid"&mdash;wherewith<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her little maid, now weeping, Rachel kissed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I also go, but weep not, I shall come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again, I trust, in happier times. Farewell!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Rachel straight to Ruth's abode returned.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Glad am I thou hast come once more," said Ruth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"For I have wished to ask thee many things.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How came his dreadful chance of martyrdom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Stephen? I can bear to hear it all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since all is done and past and&mdash;'He is safe,'<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
<span class="i0">As thou saidst, Rachel!"<br /></span>

<span class="i26">Tenderly Ruth smiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With tears behind her smiles that did not fall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Rachel said:<br /></span>

<span class="i22">"I cannot tell thee all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As having all beheld, but this I heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Stephen gave a noble testimony<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the council who had cited him;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That there his face shone like an angel's, God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself so swearing for His servant, while<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against him swore false witnesses suborned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Shimei; that his enemies could not bear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fierceness of the love with which in wrath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He burned for God against their wickedness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so they rushed upon him violently<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thrust him forth without the city walls.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But God beheld their threatening, and He sent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His Romans to withstand them for a while.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then we that loved and honored him drew nigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And would have spoken words of cheer to him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he&mdash;O Ruth, thou shouldst have seen him then!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I never can describe to thee how fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy husband was to look upon, while he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As steadfast as a star and as serene,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And not less lovely-luminous to our eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood there amid the angry Sanhedrim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to us spake such heavenly words of cheer!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He spake of thee, Ruth, and I think God gave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His spirit comfort in good hope for thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, 'God will give all to our prayers,' said he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And added, 'Husband He will be to her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Father to the fatherless.'"<br /></span>

<span class="i34">Thereat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ruth's tears as from a fresh-oped fountain flowed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And eased her aching heart, too full before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of love, remorseful love, for perfect peace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rachel with Ruth wept tears of sympathy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But with the sweet and wholesome in her tears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mixed salt and bitter, for she thought of Saul.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ruth at length ceased to weep and yearning said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And then those Romans let them work their will!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"On Stephen's body, yea, Ruth," Rachel said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"But on his spirit they could have no power."<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"The stones," said Ruth&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">"The stones, Ruth," Rachel said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"God gave His angels charge concerning them&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So verily I believe&mdash;and strictly bade,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
<span class="i0">'Lo, let these slay, but see ye that they do<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No harm unto My prophet.' So the stones,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They slew, but hurt not. God translated him;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He rose triumphant in meek majesty.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I should have told thee, Ruth, that while he stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the council, he looked up and saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jesus in heaven on the right hand of God&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There standing; this he testified to all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was as if his faithful Lord had risen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To side with Stephen in his agony.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, when they stoned him, Stephen upward spoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Lord Jesus, take my spirit'; then once more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Lord, lay not Thou this sin unto their charge.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This he said kneeling and so fell asleep."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The two some space sat musing silently;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Ruth:<br /></span>

<span class="i14">"I feel that thou hast told me all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most truly, Rachel, as most tenderly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus, then, God giveth His belovéd sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus also! And He doeth all things well!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amen!"<br /></span>

<span class="i10">Silence once more, that seemed surcharged<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With deepening inarticulate amen<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
<span class="i0">From both, and Ruth, regarding Rachel, said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Even so! But, Rachel, us not yet doth God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will thus to sleep. Still, otherwise to sleep&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For His belovéd are not also we?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May be God's gift to us. Thou surely needest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Body and spirit, rest."<br /></span>

<span class="i22">And Rachel said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The words of Stephen leap unto my lips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For answering thee; and these were Stephen's words:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'God bless thee, Martha, for thy loving thought!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this makes me remember that one thing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Done yesterday I missed to tell thee of.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Martha, faithful heart, forecasting well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brought food for Stephen that might hearten him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bear whatever he had need to bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A cake of barley and a honeycomb.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'God bless thee, Martha, for thy loving thought!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said Stephen, and so took the food from her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ate it giving thanks before us all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He ate it with such look of appetite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It cheered us with a sense of freedom his<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From any discomposure of the mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Ruth, in His pavilion God did hide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy husband, and his soul had perfect peace!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>"Was it not done like Martha?" Ruth replied;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And done like Stephen too. For courtesy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bloomed like a flower to grace his daily life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I used to wonder at it&mdash;and I now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wonder I did not see where such a flower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where, and where only, such a flower could find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rooting to flourish in a world like this!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He always told me that the heart of Christ<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nourished what good in him, or beautiful,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I found&mdash;or fancied, as he smiled and said.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I&mdash;Oh, holden heart!&mdash;I did not see.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now it is too late, too late, for him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To have known! It may be that he knows it, yea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now to know it is not wholly such<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As to have known it then, to have known it then!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas, there is not any chance of hope<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behind us, Rachel; hope is all before.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let us look onward; we in hope were saved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Stephen used to say, and, 'I go hence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In comfort of some hope,' were his last words,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or of his last, to me&mdash;concerning me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spoken with a sad cheerfulness that now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breaks me with such a surge of memory!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But this is endless, let it here have end.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Come, Rachel, see, the sun rides high, come thou,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I will bring thee to a quiet room,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Safe from the sun, where thou shalt rest a while."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So Rachel followed Ruth, not ill content<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be alone for thought if not for sleep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her will was not to sleep; but weariness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With youth and health, was stronger, and she slept.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Already, when she woke, the sun halfway<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From his high noon had down the western slope<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of sky descended, and she hearkening heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A rumorous noise without upon the ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stir of movement, steps of many feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sound, muffled, of many voices nigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That startled her from sweet forgetfulness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sudden sad remembrance of the things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That had been, and that were, and were to be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Instinctive up she sprang, for, "Lo," she said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"They gather unto Stephen's funeral;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behooves that I be ready with all speed."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therewith upon her knees she sank and prayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A prayer for Ruth and for Ruth's little ones,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Widowed and orphaned by so dear a death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for herself&mdash;and for her brother Saul!<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Then her heart swelled to a capacious wish,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, anguished in one swift vicarious throe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of great desire for help and grace divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She embraced the total church of Jesus Christ&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of such a guide, of such a stay, bereaved!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Rachel, with the Everlasting Arms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Invisibly, nigh visibly, around<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her to sustain her steps, came forth, as one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That meekly walks leaning on her beloved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And begged of Ruth that she might sister be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To her, that day, and thenceforth ever, mourn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As sister with her in the eyes of all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"For I am lonely," Rachel said, "O Ruth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As thou art; lonely let us be, we twain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Together, widows both, and mix our tears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For also I am widow, as thou art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet not as thou&mdash;since me a heavier stroke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Makes widow, who have never been a wife!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ruth answered, though she did not understand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kissed her friend in plight of sisterhood.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So they two, clad alike from out Ruth's store<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of raiment, clad in sad attire alike,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As sisters walked together side by side&mdash;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Ruth's children with them, grieved, not knowing why&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To where, from Mary's house and Martha's borne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With grievous lamentation, by good men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Devout, the flower and choice of Israel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was laid the sacred dust of Stephen down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sealed within a rock-hewn sepulchre.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Joseph of Arimathæa, he who sought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gained from Pilate leave to take away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The body of Jesus crucified, had sent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Bethany, betimes, before the hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of burial, rich spices, a great weight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aloes and myrrh, with linen pure and fine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wrap the body of Stephen for his tomb.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mary, the mother of the Lord, with John<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beloved of Jesus, loving her as son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came to that feast of sorrow bringing tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Ruth medicinal more than any, wept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By one who had so learned to weep. So there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sackcloth worn and ashes on the head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They wailed aloud, that Hebrew company,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Women and men, they beat the breast, they rent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their raiment, until one stood forth who said:<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
<span class="i0">"Enough already has to grief been given.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Us it befits not here, for Stephen dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To mourn as mourn others who have no hope.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was a burning and a shining light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we a season in his beams were glad.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glory to God who kindled him for us!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glory to God who hath from us withdrawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His shining, and now hides him in Himself!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We thought we could not spare him, but God knew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let all be as God wills Who knows. Amen!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Amen!" they solemnly responded all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he who spake these things went on and said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The Lord anointed Stephen with the oil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of gladness in the gift of speech above<br /></span>

<h2>BOOK X.</h2>

<h3>SAUL AT BETHANY.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">&nbsp;</a></span></p>


<p>At the funeral service for Stephen, Shimei was a skulking
attendant. He catches at a mention there overheard by him of
the name of Saul in connection with that of Stephen, to plot an
instigated persecuting visit on Saul's part to Bethany; Shimei
hoping that Saul will thus encounter his own sister identified
as a Christian. Saul takes a band of men and makes the
visit. He finds his intended victims all together at the house
of Ruth condoling with her&mdash;Rachel indeed among them.
After sharp inward conflict, and much effort put forth without
success to make his victims abjure their faith, Saul finally
takes them to prison. But Rachel, she vainly entreating to
share her companions' fate, he leaves behind. She takes
upon herself the charge of Ruth's children in their own home,
where Saul, month after month, secretly sends to her supply
of every need.</p>

<h4>SAUL AT BETHANY.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Among the sons of God, when these one day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came to present themselves before the Lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Satan came also; and so Shimei,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the throng that mourned at Stephen's death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Intruded. With smooth face of sanctimony,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Skulking to be unseen or heeded not,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He hovered furtive on the outer edge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of audience, when those words of praise were said<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hearten&mdash;eye and ear alert to mark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All that befell. His thought was, 'Here perhaps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shall learn something to the true behoof<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And profit of our cause&mdash;right aim secure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the next blow of vengeance to be struck.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The name of Saul mysteriously conjoined<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Rachel's, in abhorrent prophecy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As seemed&mdash;this, Shimei caught at eagerly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said, 'Aha!'<br /></span>

<span class="i18">Then, as the throng dispersed<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
<span class="i0">All to their several homes, straight Shimei<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went to seek Saul. Him found that spy malign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the chief priests in council, plotting deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hunt the sect of Jesus to the death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These had armed Saul with writ and warrant sealed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Empowering him to enter where he would,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">House after house, and whomsoever found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Man be it or woman, guilty of belief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Jesus as Messiah, such to seize<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drag to prison.<br /></span>

<span class="i22">Instantly conceived<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shimei a subtle snare to enmesh the feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Saul. The proud young zealot Pharisee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should be set on to visit first in search<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those homes of Bethany; where, unadvised<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps, so Shimei guessed, the brother might,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To his dismay, find his own sister one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the disciples of the Nazarene.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then to make prisoner his own flesh and blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or openly spare Rachel for kin's sake&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This, scandal against scandal doubtful weighed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would be the hard alternative to Saul.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Belovéd brother Saul," so Shimei spoke,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
<span class="i0">"<em>I</em> mourned at Stephen's funeral to-day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not loud, you know, but deep, my mourning was;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not loud, for I am modest, and my wish<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was less to be seen than to see; but deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For there was cause, to one that loved you, Saul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be sincerely sad on your behalf.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Incredible it seems, they spoke your name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not, as might honor it, with hate and dread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But very ambiguously, to say the least.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In fact, I fear you may be compromised,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unless you take prompt measures in the matter.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hark you, a certain orator stood up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, after praising Stephen to his worth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Distinctly hinted Saul was looked upon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As hopeful future pervert to their cause<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Predestined to fill Stephen's vacant room.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fellow founded on some prophecy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, as I gathered, Stephen had put forth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now this preposterous notion, with such folk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is far more like to prosper, and thus be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Noised undesirably, than you might guess,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a report injurious to your name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You will be tainted with disloyalty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In general esteem&mdash;to our great loss.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>"What I propose is that you strike a stroke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So sudden and so ringing and so aimed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As shall decisively and neatly nip<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This precious piece of prophecy in the bud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And put you out of reach of calumny.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You have your warrant and commission; good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Use them at once, sleep not upon them; now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This very night&mdash;for domiciliary work<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like what you purpose, night is the best time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Birds to their nests, you know, at night come home&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This very night, take you a trusty band<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And make a bold foray at Bethany.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There Stephen lived, and there a hotbed yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrives of this pestilent heresy. No place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fitter than the abode and vicinage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of your late overmatch in controversy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make first theatre of the exploits<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You aim at in this different field&mdash;field where,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With odds so in your favor, you should win.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Easier far, given the right support, to drag<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To dungeon and to death a hundred men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or praying women, all as tame as sheep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than one impracticable fellow like<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Stephen manage in fair controversy!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Ask for the house that harbored Stephen's corpse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whence the funeral issued&mdash;quarry there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You cannot fail to find. The widow too<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Stephen, I watched her, and what I saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Makes me misdoubt her Hebrew orthodoxy.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">May call you cruel; the worst cruelty,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">This thing must be stamped out; it is a plague,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It creeps from house to house, no house is safe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your house, Saul, mine&mdash;that sister fair of yours,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes, treat the thought with scorn, but some fine day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why not? Saul wakes to find his sister lost."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How far unconsciously, Saul could not guess,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Shimei, in that last home thrust of his,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Either by pure fortuity, or else<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With malice the most exquisitely wise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had hit the quivering quick of Saul's sore pride.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saul winced visibly, and Shimei, satisfied,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Left him alone the prey of his own thoughts.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Saul's thoughts were visions rather; first, he saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His sister as in that farewell with her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bowed beautiful beneath a brother's scorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a meek flower broken with tempest; then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stephen he saw, his face with God in him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Afire, before the council; next, that face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Toward heaven upturned, he, far within the veil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Agaze, beholding there the glory of God;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more, the martyr lifting holy hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On high, with his last breath praying for those<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That slew him, praying also then for Saul!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rachel the while&mdash;she rather felt than seen&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With tears that did not gather, but that made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her deep eyes deeper than the soundless sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looking at him. Swift then the vision changed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he saw Stephen in the temple court<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turn suddenly round on Saul his blinding face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To threaten him with promise that, one day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He, Saul himself, should grovel in the dust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the feet of Jesus crucified!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those visions were as when the lightning-flash,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By night, fast following lightning-flash, reveals,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
<span class="i0">One instant and no more, the world, but prints<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its image on the eye intensely bright.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The final vision wrought a fierce revolt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Saul from that relenting which, before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The earlier visions almost made him feel.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As with a mortal gripe, his vise-like will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clutched at his heart and held it fast and hard.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scorning to be diverted from his path<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because, forsooth, the meddling Shimei<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pointed it out to him offensively,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saul moved at once to go to Bethany.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seven servitors he chose, strong men whom use<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had, hand and heart, seasoned to such employ&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With these a guide&mdash;and started on his way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again the moon shone, as the yesternight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And flooded heaven and earth with glory mild.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But her mild glory now was a rebuke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To human passion, not a balm to pain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With swords and staves armed, as that night came they<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who looked for Jesus in Gethsemane&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The needless lamps and torches in their hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With flare and smoke affronting the moonlight&mdash;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
<span class="i0">They marched, those seven, following the guide with Saul.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At first these chattered lightly as they walked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But soon the stern, stark, wordless mood of Saul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his grim purpose in his pace expressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Urgent and swift, taxing their utmost strength<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To follow and not fall behind, quite quelled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The social spirit in all, and on all went<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sullen silence like their chief. Like him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Insensibly each moment more and more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While thought and feeling they shut strictly up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within them from all vent in speech, they these<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Changed to brute instinct of vindictiveness;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Insensibly, like him, with every step<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of vehement ongoing, vehement<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Propulsion gathered they in mind and will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To reach and grapple with their task. So on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And up with speed they pressed toward Bethany.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At Bethany, meanwhile, the flock in fold<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With Rachel sat together, in the court<br /></span>

<span class="i2">'Jehovah fixed the blessing, life, even life<br /></span>

<span class="i20">"A sweet strain and a rich,"<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Something it lacks to fill the measure up<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In Jesus, since He came, since Jesus came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spake, then went, but came again, in us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forever to abide. Cannot we sing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some words of His, as tunable, more deep?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such words He spake in a celestial rhythm<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
<span class="i0">That night before He sought Gethsemane.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They sat as in the Holy of holies with Him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And John leaned on His bosom where He sat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have heard John rehearse the heavenly words<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until at length I too have them by heart."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Lazarus gave them sentences, which all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chanted in simple measure low and sweet:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Let not your heart be troubled, ye believe<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'In God, also in Me believe. Within<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'My Father's house there many mansions are.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'I should have told you, had it not been so,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Because I go to fit a place for you.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'And if I go and fit for you a place,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'I shall return and take you to Myself,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'That where I am there ye may also be.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Was it a premonition, or did grief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surge up through peace and joy to claim its own?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said Lazarus: "Yet He told us, 'In the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye will have tribulation, though in Me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye shall have peace.' With tribulation, peace!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">His closing words they took from Lazarus' lips,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Or wholly glad in sadness, which they sang.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When ever were there cadences more sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More sweet or more pathetic? Thrice sang they<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those words together; but, at the fourth time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just in that breath between the rise and fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before from 'tribulation' they touched 'peace'&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A shock as of a mace struck on the door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which yielded, and abrupt there strode in&mdash;Saul!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Saul was alone; his men he left without.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The band had first the sisters' dwelling sought,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Without delay, they came to Ruth's abode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fiercer from disappointment Saul. But though<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ruthless he came, he now, arrested there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ruthful a moment stood at gaze. He saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Four women and one man in simple sort<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sitting together in communion still.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They did not look like culprits, nay, a light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Purer than purest moonlight seemed to shine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From out their faces underneath the moon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was a feast of comfort that they kept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those four, with Ruth the widowed&mdash;this Saul saw,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He would have turned and left them, but&mdash;his men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without! The chief priests and the Sanhedrim!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To Saul's fair fame, his conscience, and his God!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">This all was in an instant, while he yet<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His sister in her sombre different garb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disguised and in the half light of the moon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Rachel now he fully recognized,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Saul, with his finger pointing to her seat,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Saul ceased, awaiting what those five would do.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
<span class="i0">They did not look at one another; all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As with one will to all&mdash;their eyes upraised,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their hands clasped in ecstasy of awe&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Together "Alleluia Jesus!" said.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Saul a power like lightning fallen from heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell, at that adoration from their lips.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A moment he stood stupefied, and then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a great wrench of scornful will, he freed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself and summoned his retainers in.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">These entered rudely, but abashed they hung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wondering saw their master half abashed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before that little company clothed on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With virtue like a dreadful panoply.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half with the air of one subdued, or one<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Saul bids bind all&mdash;save Rachel&mdash;and forthwith<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lead them to prison.<br /></span>

<span class="i22">"Also me, bind me,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Rachel to the men said eagerly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And offered her fair wrists. They looked at Saul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Saul vouchsafed to them nor word nor sign.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still, 'No,' they gathered from that cold aspect<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In him which seemed to say, 'That which I bid,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Do, further, naught.' Rachel to Saul himself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beseechingly then turned and said: "O Saul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full well I know thou doest this, constrained<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By conscience. Then by conscience be constrained<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To let thy men bind also me, who am<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As guilty as these are and with them should share<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One lot."<br /></span>
<span class="i10">"I did not come here to be taught<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My duty," Saul said, "least of all by thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And least of all from thee will I abide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be adjured as by my conscience. Once<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I had a sister, she was conscience to me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, as I told thee, that was long ago,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she is dead, my sister!"<br /></span>

<span class="i34">Sadness mixed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unmeant, resisted, irresistible,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Saul's enforced hardheartedness, which broke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His tone to pathos, and, despite himself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With those last words he burst in tears. He shook<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In shudders of strong agony, while all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wondered, but Rachel did not wonder, she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knew far too well her brother, far too well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knew their joint past, the two pasts they had had<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Together, long and happy one, and one<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
<span class="i0">So brief, so bitter,&mdash;and she pitied Saul.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She pitied him, but strongly did not weep&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though afterward, alone, remembering,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She wept as if her eyes were fountains of tears&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With him now Rachel would not weep, for she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knew far too well her brother, that he scorned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself for weeping those hot tears, and would<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be vexed to see tears wept in sympathy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if with will he let his mood relent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Rachel held her pity hard shut up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within her heart, which ached the more denied<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its wished-for vent in tears, and Saul soon curbed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His passion and in other passion veiled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Haste, there!" he said, sharp turning on his men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The night flies, while ye loiter."<br /></span>

<span class="i32">Now the men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Already had bound Lazarus. He, ere yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shameful needless bonds upon the wrists<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of those four gentle women were made fast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said: "Saul, what evil have these women done<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That they deserve roughness like this? I go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Willingly with thee, albeit innocent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I a man am and can well endure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bonds, stripes, dungeon, or death, having such hope<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Within me as makes all afflictions light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whatever they may be, compared with that<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eternal weight of glory nigh at hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like hope have also these, and they will bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doubtless, supported, whatsoever ill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unmerited thou choosest to inflict.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But wilt thou choose to inflict indignity<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pain on such as these?"<br /></span>

<span class="i30">"I do not choose,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said Saul; "I without choosing do, not what<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would, but what I must. I too wear chains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Am bond of conscience, heavier chains wear I<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But leave the heart free and one's will one's own.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Both will and heart in me under the lash<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cower, and I here as but a galley-slave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do what my conscience bids, joyless, and fierce<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From lack of joy, more miserable far,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Binding, than ye are bound, with your fool's joy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of windy hope! For me, I only know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, in whatever way, this thing accursed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This craze to think <em>that</em> man the Christ, must be<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Curbed, checked, stopped, crushed, brought to an utter end,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forever. All the future of our race<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hangs on it. Woman, tempted, fell, she first,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Eden, whence is all our woe, and now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Women it seems are the peculiar prey<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of this new trick of devilish subtlety;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Ungovernably. So women, too&mdash;the cause<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In part of the disease&mdash;must in part pay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The price of cure. For remedy this is,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not punishment. Ye for the general health<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suffer&mdash;for your own health not less, if ye<br /></span>

<span class="i0">All this, I trust, will not last very long,<br /></span>

<h2>BOOK XI.</h2>

<h3>SAUL AND HIRANI.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">&nbsp;</a></span></p>


<p>Saul, ill-content with his own prosperity in persecution,
retires gloomily, late at night, to his desolated home. He
vainly tries to sleep, and, rising very early, goes to consult
Gamaliel. Returning, he encounters Shimei, who, with
gibes, instigates a further act of persecution on Saul's part,
cunningly contriving it to make refusal impossible. Saul
attempting the arrest proposed by Shimei meets with opposition,
which the latter has secretly inspired. The persecutor
in consequence narrowly escapes violent death, being rescued
at the critical moment by Shimei; who himself, with a band
of servitors, makes the arrest unsuccessfully attempted by
Saul alone. The man arrested confesses Jesus before the Sanhedrim,
constant against every inducement to deny his Lord.
He is scourged, at the instance of Shimei, and finally, at the
instance of Mattathias, stoned; Saul in both cases giving
his vote against the man.</p>

<h4>SAUL AND HIRANI.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With large prosperity and little joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus the first stage of that 'straight path' foreseen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By him to Rachel, 'traced in blood and tears,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saul had accomplished, and the night was late;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He parted from his men and was alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone and moody, by the westering moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His face downcast turned absently toward what<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Late was his home, home longer not to him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With footstep slow suspended by sad thought&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which had no goal, but ever round and round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On one fixed centre hopelessly revolved&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saul paced the still streets of Jerusalem,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a soul seeking rest and finding none.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the door at length he finds himself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his own house forsaken yesterday.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For an uncertain absence, but for long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he supposed, Saul thence that morn had fled<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
<span class="i0">In haste and bitterness. He could not bear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To think of meeting Rachel day by day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that great gulf impassable between<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her and himself yawning! he hands imbrued<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps in blood of those she counted dear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he most hateful counted bringing home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her innocent white hands to touch, and feel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The difference! Therefore he fled because<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Rachel,' thought he, 'must bide, and bide we twain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cannot.' But now Rachel was gone, and Saul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone and lonely, sojourner might be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where brother and sister late had shared a home.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He enters noiselessly, and unperceived<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Steals to his chamber; there upon his couch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To restless thought, he, not to rest, lies down.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Restless and fruitless, save that, morning yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pearl-white, untinted with that ruddy flush<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of color in the east before the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saul rose, and, after joyless orisons,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went to Gamaliel's house, sure him to find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Already on his roof to greet the dawn.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In anguish sore and sore perplexity<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of spirit, master," Saul said, "lo, I come<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
<span class="i0">To thee, not knowing whither else to go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For solace, and the solving of my doubt."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Welcome thou comest ever, even or morn,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gamaliel said; "but what disquiets thee?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When in the council last I heard thee speak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou wert all firmness, as one wholly clear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In purpose, and thou hadst that glad aspect,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though serious, which befits the mind resolved.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whence, Saul, the change in thee?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i22">"Thou knowest," said Saul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"How prospered my attempt, ventured upon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without thy counsel, in that issue joined<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Stephen."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i16">"Yea, my son," Gamaliel said;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"But I, meantime, after my counsel given<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dissuading thee, had learned myself to feel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How failed the hand of brute authority<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against this strange faith of the Nazarene.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thine undertaking I less disapproved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After our hearing of the Galilæans.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Something perceived in them, or through them felt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disturbed me with a strange solicitude,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Which the ill fortune of thine own assay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did not relieve. But thou, thou still wert clear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wert thou not, Saul? Thine action did not halt;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Promptly in Stephen's stoning thou took'st part."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I acted promptly, that I might be clear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In thought," said Saul; "this, rather than because<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I was so clear. My halting urged me on.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet now, O master mine, I might perhaps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be clear, but that my coadjutorship<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Offends me so, torments me with such doubt.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the right way how can I be, and be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the same way with Shimei? My soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sickens at him, at all his words and ways<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sickens, and still he dogs me every step,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clings to me like my shadow, whispers me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over my shoulder, pointing me out my way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until I hardly can do that which else<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Freely I should, because he bids me do it!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Yea, Saul, my son, trust thou thine instinct there,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gravely Gamaliel said, with slow reserve<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That warned how more than he would say was meant;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Our brother Shimei is a dark man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose public zeal is edged with private spite;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Him well, son Saul, it thee behooves beware.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since when thou scornedst him in those high words<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the council, Shimei hates thee, Saul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hate like his is sleepless till revenge.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ill for a cause that must be served by him!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But some are tools, and others ministers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of God, Who works His holy will with all!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Unwarned by warning, but in conscience pricked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And following his own tyrannous thought, Saul spoke:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Those infamous false witnesses of his&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say, master, did I on my conscience take<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The guilt of their suborning, when consent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I gave to Stephen's death thereby procured?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My conscience like a scorpion stings me on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But whether a good conscience before God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It be, or rather a conscience violated,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which I must quiet by not heeding it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by confusing it with din of deeds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forever doing&mdash;this I cannot well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resolve me, and&mdash;but, nay, for that were false,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I do not wish thou shouldst resolve me it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forgive me, and farewell! But pray for Saul!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Therewith, and pausing not, like one distraught,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Or one goaded, and wildly seeking fast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enough before the goad to fly, which flies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only the faster, following, for his speed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pricks the harder&mdash;so Saul broke away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And left Gamaliel on his roof alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Astonished.<br /></span>

<span class="i14">Swiftly now, yet with a haste<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As of one wishing to leave far behind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some spot abhorred, much more than as of one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eager a goal before him to attain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say rather as of one insanely fierce<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Somewhither, anywhither, from himself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pursuing hard himself, to fly, Saul flew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back toward his dwelling. At the door arrived,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He well-nigh stumbled&mdash;for his hasting feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against some shapeless heap struck that alive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seemed, for it moved, and from the threshold, where<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He in a kind of ambush crouching lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slowly into the semblance of a man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under Saul's eyes down bent, upgrew&mdash;Shimei!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Sin coucheth at the door!' thought Saul; he thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half of himself, as half of Shimei,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
<span class="i0">For, 'If thou doest not well, thou Saul!' thought he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, "Reptile! How beneath my heel should I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His serpent head have bruised!" hissed hotly out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between his set teeth, and perused the man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half under breath this, then to him aloud:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What art thou? Imp of hell spawned hither new<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up from the pit? Avaunt! I loathe thee hence!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Nay, brother Saul," grinned Shimei, therefore pleased<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus spurned to be, because the spurning was<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With anguish of disgust to him who spurned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Malevolently yet storing reserve<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of hatred and revenge therefor, to be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Afterward feasted when the time should come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Nay, brother Saul, you look with eyesight dazed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From undersleeping, and from rash surprise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At this encounter. I am Shimei,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your special coadjutor tried and true.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am a little early, I confess&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or late, which shall I call it? early and late&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like moral good and evil, Saul&mdash;ofttimes<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I got prompt information how it all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell out, and hastened hither to advise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With you. Upon your sleep, already much<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cut short, I would not thoughtlessly break in,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so I dropped me at your threshold here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wait a proper hour for seeing you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet not let you pass out hence unseen.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I must have fallen asleep, and, brother Saul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be sure I was no less surprised than you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When you just now came on me unaware.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ha! ha! How naturally you mistook your friend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For something not so pleasant from the pit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vomited suddenly up under your feet!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another might have taken it amiss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be so little courteously greeted,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I&mdash;why, give and take, say I, in joke,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Saul's look, his tone, had withered any man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save Shimei, who grew blithe in sultry heats<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of human scorn as in his element.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Shimei flourished lustier hearing Saul<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"What is there common between you and me?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh! Ah!" sneered Shimei; "I had thought you dazed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In eyesight only, but distempered mind<br /></span>

<span class="i0">'What common 'twixt us?' Yea, yea, very good!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Quite white and fair of all complicity<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With 'lies,' 'devilish lies,' 'lies damnable,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You know, and so forth, and in due course then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His moral indignation unabated,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Takes profit of said lies to make away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Stephen, through more weighty argument<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In stones found than conveniently to hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came when he crossed words with that heretic!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>The mordant sneer corrosive of such speech<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ate through the thin mail of Saul's scornful pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bit him in his wincing sense of truth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against these thrusts in no wise could he fence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Having the foothold lost whereon he stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Firm in the conscience of integrity.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unbidden would those words of Stephen, "Pricks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To kick against!" returning come to him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In memory, while ever, with each return,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fiercer waxed Saul's resistance, fiercer wound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Infixing in his secret-suffering mind&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As should the bullock battle with the goads<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Against the cruel points of Shimei's jeer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And suffered them in silence.<br /></span>

<span class="i32">Shimei<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Felt his own triumph, and at feline ease<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leisurely played with his proud captive. "Saul,"<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To waste strength here in mutual blame. Forgive<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then Shimei, ever easily equal found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To his occasion, when need seemed to him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of whatsoever fraud in word or act,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said that of course from brother Saul was heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never aught other than he deemed was true;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the fact was, as would by witnesses<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be amply proved, that all this culprit's show<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of zeal to stay those rioters back was show<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Merely, dust in the eyes of Saul to cast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or rather sport to make of him, the prey<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Secure supposed of his, the prisoner's,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Malicious machination through the hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his confederates, or tools, who knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Better their master's purposes, his real<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Purposes, than his feigned dissuasive words<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To heed, and let his victim go. Saul's state<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was at the moment such, so ill at ease<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His mind&mdash;why, even his body in that vile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Duress was hardly to be called his own&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saul&mdash;and without offence would Shimei say it&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might be regarded as not competent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On this particular point to testify.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At all events, here were good witnesses<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Who, from a safer, steadier point of view<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than Saul's, and longer occupied, could tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both what the prisoner's wont had been to teach,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what he instigated in this case.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With such preamble to prepare their minds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Minds used to guess the drift of Shimei's wish,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This arch-artificer of fraud produced<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As witnesses the men whom he had late<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mixed with Hirani's audience to foment<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That lawlessness. Such serviceable tongues<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Failed not to swear, in all, as Shimei wished.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Saul, in his secret mind with anguish torn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gazed at the man forsworn against, maligned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And almost envied him. A look of peace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was on him like a light of fixéd stars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So constant, and so inaccessible<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of change through jar, through stain, so clear, so fair!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He listened to the voices round him loud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if some softer voice from farther sent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made ever an inner music to his mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Charming him with a melody unheard.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He saw the things, the faces, and the forms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About him nigh, as if he looked beyond<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Or through them, and beheld far, far away<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So when the high-priest, from his middle seat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the councillors, accosted him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Asking, "To all these things what sayest thou?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The prisoner, like one absent-minded brought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sudden sense of present things, replied:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I hardly understand what 'these things' are,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I praise Him as the Lord of life and light,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">All glory to His ever-blesséd Name!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The simple ecstasy from which he spoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Illuminated, and the holy power<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Of truth, in witness such, meekly so borne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wrought even upon the jealous Sanhedrim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An influence which they could not resist,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a pang shot to the inmost heart of Saul.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A faltering of compunction close on shame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made the high-priest half-tenderly, with tone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As of a father toward a child in fault,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say: "Nay, my son, deceived art thou; of will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surely thou dost not utter blasphemy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If so be demon power had leave from God<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So the high-priest to him, but he replied:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"A bold blasphemer!" so, discordant, shrieked<br /></span>

<h2>BOOK XII.</h2>

<h3>SAUL AND THE APOSTLES.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">&nbsp;</a></span></p>


<p>Again deeply distressed in heart, Saul at set of sun withdraws
to the top of Olivet for solitary thought. There
falling asleep, after pensive soliloquy, he dreams that Shimei
has followed him thither, and that he now pours a characteristic
strain of sneer and instigation into his ear. This
rouses him, and he goes moodily home. After a long, deep
slumber there, he resolves on undertaking what he dreamed
that Shimei proposed, namely, the arrest of the apostles.
His men fail him at the pinch, and Saul bitterly upbraids
them, declaring strongly that their renegade behavior only
determines him the more sternly to root utterly out the
pestilent Galilæan heresy, at whatever cost of exertion and
blood and tears.</p>

<h4>SAUL AND THE APOSTLES.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So one day more of bitterness had spent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saul, and the night, the solemn night, came on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grateful to him, for he would be alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether the thought of home, no home, repelled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or longing toward his sister unconfessed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There in that banishment at Bethany<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright with her presence in it&mdash;whether this<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drew him, or wish of lonely room and height<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where more he might from human kind be far&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">However listing, Saul to Olivet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turned him, and slowly to the summit climbed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The moon not risen yet, the hemisphere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of heaven above him was with clustered stars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glittering, and awful with the glory of God.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upward into those lucid azure deeps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Withdrawn, deep beyond deep, immeasurably,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gazing, Saul said: "Deep calleth unto deep!<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Those deeps above me unto deeps within<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Me cry, as infinite to infinite.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spaces of my spirit answer back;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I feel them, empty but capacious, vast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And void abysses of unfed desire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hunger eternal and eternal thirst!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upward I gaze, and see the steadfast stars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unshaken in their station calmly shine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I listen to the silence of the skies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yearn, with what desire! for peace like that,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vainly, with what desire! for peace like that!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the pure calm of the holy heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So nigh! here am I seething like the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That cannot rest, casting up mire and dirt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Continually! O state forlorn! Where, where,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My God, for me is rest? For me, for me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Great peace have they,' so sang that psalmist taught<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Thee, 'Great peace have they that love Thy law<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nothing shall offend them.' Answer me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lord God, do <em>I</em> not love Thy law? Then why<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This opposite of peace within my breast?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Am I deceived? Do <em>not</em> I love Thy law?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Answer me Thou!"<br /></span>

<span class="i16">But answer came there none,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Or Saul was deaf, and the great sky looked down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all its multitude of starry eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Impassible, upon a human soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wretched, unrespited from long unrest.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The weary man upon a spot of ground<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bare to the heaven had thrown himself supine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lying diffuse, his wistful face upturned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And poring on the starry-scriptured scroll<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above him, he such thoughts breathed out in words.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had deemed himself alone, aloof from men;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But seemed had scarce his murmurous monotone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Died on his lips, he skyward gazing still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he was conscious of approaching feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feet all at once so nigh, they in the dark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Touched him ere he could rouse himself to stand.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Why, brother Saul! I stumble on you here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Much as this morn you stumbled over me!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such, to the sleeping man, a voice seemed borne.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Those odious false-cheery tones once more!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shimei has watched, and, hither following me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lurked overhearing my soliloquy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, stealthily retiring a few steps,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Comes back, as with the brisk and frank advance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of one somewhither walking at full speed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stumbles against me of purpose rude!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So Saul divined dissembling Shimei,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who said, or to Saul, dreaming, seemed to say&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vision as life-like as reality:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"How naturally appear our paths to cross!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I thought that I would take a casual stroll<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone, and you the same thought had, it seems,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the same time, directed both, odd too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The self-same way&mdash;another proof, you see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What kindred spirits we are!<br /></span>

<span class="i26">"You must have marked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How fine the night is! What a wealth of stars!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do you not sometimes wish, Saul, you could be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As comfortably calm at heart as stars?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How wonderfully quiet all is there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up in the region of the firmament!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Probably stars have nothing else to do<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than to be calm like that, and smile at us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fretting ourselves down here with worry and work.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Worry is worse than work to wear us out.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But worst of all is having huge desires<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
<span class="i0">That nothing in the world can satisfy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some men moon sighing for they know not what,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mainly great hollow hungry mouths and maws,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like void sea-beds; abysses of desire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You know, that not the world itself could fill.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Better close up your heart than stretch it wide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And never get enough to make it full.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adjust yourself, say I, to circumstance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hard work adjusting circumstance to you!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's nothing better than to go right on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doing the obvious duty next to hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let the stars pursue their peaceful way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As hindered not, so envied not, by you.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sky is calm, no doubt&mdash;the upper sky&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But happens we do not live in the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But on the earth, a very different place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And man's work we, not star's work, have to do;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So let us be about it while we may.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"For instance now, to bring the matter home<br /></span>

<span class="i0">This is forsaking you, I grieve to find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On all sides round, wherever I inquire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up, and recover it with one bold push,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Push that dares hazard all upon a cast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You know twelve men there are in special sort<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dubbed the 'apostles' of the Nazarene,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">These fellows boldly in Jerusalem<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Some kind of superstitious charm or awe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surrounds them&mdash;that is, in their own conceit<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Boldly arrest them, Saul, and spoil the spell."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus far, as oft in dreams will chance, Saul lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And helpless heard what irked him sore to hear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now, the loathing irrepressible<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Excited by such hateful speech, roused him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To spurning that asunder broke the bonds,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The nightmare bonds, of sleep. He, full awake,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He sprang upon his feet, and in the light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the waned moon, now risen, still large and fair,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A dream, then," Saul said, "only a hideous dream!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Perhaps a demon whispered these now to me!<br /></span>

<h2>BOOK XIII.</h2>

<h3>SAUL AND SERGIUS.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">&nbsp;</a></span></p>


<p>After further persecution accomplished by him in Judæa,
Saul, with spirits recovered, sets out for Damascus to carry
thither the persecuting sword. Pausing on the brow of hill
Scopus to survey Jerusalem just left, he soliloquizes. At the
same moment, there rides up a troop of Roman horse escorting
a man who turns out to be Sergius Paulus, an old-time
acquaintance of Saul's, also bound to Damascus. The two
pursue their journey together, highly enjoying their ride in
that charming season of spring weather, and delightedly
conversing on the way. They talk over Greek literature, and
in particular by starlight at the close of the first day's
journey, Sergius Paulus having by occasion recited an
apposite passage of Homer, Saul matches and contrasts this
first with a psalm of David, and then additionally with a strain
from the prophet Isaiah. This gives rise to conversation on
ensuing days, in which religious questions are discussed.
Sergius declares himself an atheist of the Epicurean sort,
and he plies Saul with incredulous inquiries about the religion
of the Jews&mdash;Saul answering with Hebrew conviction and
earnestness. The two part company at Neapolis (Shechem)
because Sergius Paulus halts there, and Saul, in the spirit of
true Jewish strictness, will for his part not rest till he has
quite passed the bounds of Samaria.</p>

<span class="i0">The youthful Roman to the youthful Jew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inclined in distant salutation meant<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For natural courtesy due from peer to peer.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saul, in like wise, his greeting gave him back;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His horse, and halting, said: "Peace, but methinks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw thee late, months since it may have been,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where that fanatic Stephen suffered death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With stoning at your angry elders' hands."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I, in that act of punishment," said Saul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"As loyal Jew befitted, took my part."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Nay, but as now I read thy features nigh,"<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>

<span class="i0">Somewhere we twain must earlier still have met.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Tarsus I some boyish seasons spent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I there, by chance full well-remembered, knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Hebrew-Roman boy whose name was Saul."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Then Sergius Paulus is thy name," said Saul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And Saul am I&mdash;and Saul to Sergius, peace!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who but as man and man just now had met<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"Thy face is toward Jerusalem," to Saul<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Damascus-ward turned Saul his horse's head,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"The allotment of my tribe," said Saul&mdash;"my tribe<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With sign and wonder thence delivering them<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To see or hear, in sanction of His law&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A wide and long champaign of fruitful green,<br /></span>

<h2>BOOK XIV.</h2>

<h3>FOR DAMASCUS.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">&nbsp;</a></span></p>


<p>Coming together again at Cæsarea Philippi (Paneas, Banias)
after an interval of days, Saul and Sergius cross the
southern spur of Hermon. A violent thunderstorm comes
slowly up during the afternoon, which gives Sergius occasion,
by way of mask to his own secret disquietude, to quote his
Epicurean poet Lucretius on the subject of Jupiter's control
of thunderbolts. As the storm increases in violence, the
fears of Sergius overpower him, and he breaks down at last
into a deprecatory prayer and vow to Jupiter. Saul then,
the storm still raging, rehearses from Scripture appropriate
fragments of psalm, timing them to the various successive
bursts of tempest. The sound of a tranquil human voice has
a quieting effect on Sergius, and even on the frightened
steeds of the two travellers. The storm ceases, and they pass
the night under a serene sky, ready to set out the next morning
for the last stage of their journey to Damascus.</p>

<h2>BOOK XV.</h2>

<h3>SAUL AND JESUS.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">&nbsp;</a></span></p>


<p>The scene of the poem changes, being transferred to Paradise.
Here a group composed of those who had come to
their death by the hands of Saul assemble, privileged by
special grace to witness from their celestial station the happy
overthrow and conversion of their late persecutor. Sergius
applies his interpretation of the occurrence, and Saul finishes
his journey on foot, blind, led by the hand into Damascus.</p>

<span class="i0">Give him in that forever-imminent Day&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor him alone, as his vicarious soul<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The grateful joy, within those friendly minds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above who saw it, borne to ecstasy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of gladness, was triumphal, and broke forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In singing such as heard in Paradise:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Forth for Damascus from Jerusalem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rode breathing threat and slaughter quenchless sworn<br /></span>
